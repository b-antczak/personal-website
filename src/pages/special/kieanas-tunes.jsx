Next to it a markerboard full of formulas, problems, and more Greek symbols than you can imagine. I see you studying hard, headphones in, learning, persisting, and solving problems. I see the productive, passionate nerd that I fell in love with. Personally, this is my favourite song on the playlist.',

I see a meticulous woman who knows that perfection cannot be rushed.

It\'s funny because I DO in fact ramble on sometimes, I get it after my dad.

Its music hits such a precise part of me whose sole purpose is to remind me about every wonderful thing about you, I don\'t know how to explain it.

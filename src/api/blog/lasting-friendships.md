As a child growing up, I wasn’t very social. Back then, I was the scrawny, dorky kid who spent most of their childhood at home playing online flash games and watching video game walkthroughs on YouTube.

But on the rare occasions when I would visit a friend’s house, I would afterwards have a rush of adrenaline for weeks on end. I would ride that high as much as I could. I saw the experience of spending time with someone outside of school as a luxury, and that’s why I cherished it so much. This is because I saw the act of staying home with my online games as something normal. That’s just how I decided to raise myself.

Now of course, this backfired obviously. My ignorance of social etiquette caused me to be bullied in elementary school, pushing back the development of my social skills even further.

Fortunately, once my sister (who was far more social than I was) noticed this, she took the initiative to help me become a more socially intelligent individual.

Fast forward to grade 12, I was no longer bullied and racked up quite a bit of social experience. I met a unique group of students: Brett, Matt, and Jonny. They were unique because they didn’t just meet up after school to play the new Call of Duty video game. No, they went on adventures outside of the city we lived in, camped out underneath train bridges without a tent, and explored abandoned houses and buildings wherever they could. They were up for any adventure, no matter the challenge. These students were something straight out of the movie *Stand By Me*. Yes, they were a tightly-knit unit.

They were also my classmates, and I was friends with them. One particular day during the second semester of our grade 12 year, they invited me out on an adventure of theirs. Another classmate of ours, Daniel, was also invited.

Our adventure consisted of walking on tracks and trekking through the thick winter snow, as it was winter time. We eventually stumbled under a highway pass. There, Daniel and I were informed that the group would like us join their tightly-knit rag tag unit. You could tell that they thought about this for a while, and seeing the kind of positive energy that they had, Daniel and I accepted. And so, the group of three became a group of five. They considered us because we shared the same values: a love for adventure, a passion to rise up to any challenge, and the idea of respect and trust as the ulterior guiding principle in a group.

That occurred in early 2015, and since then, our group has only become closer. We’ve been on countless adventures, each with their own unique story.

We’ve visited the nation’s capital and discovered where to find the greatest wings you will ever taste at a bar in Gatineau
We’ve explored countless miles of tracks and along with them many bridges
I was able to experience camping out under a train bridge in the countryside with nothing but a blanket and a fire pit
We played pond hockey, lived in the moment, and hung out every chance we got
I’ve become very close with these men. I cannot even describe the impact that they had and continue to have on my life. I genuinely do not know where I would be today — socially, academically, and even physically — if it were not for them.

That is the impact of a lasting, true friendship. And I believe it is one of the most important factors to a healthy lifestyle.

People put focus generally on a healthy diet or an appropriate amount of exercise as the most important factor. While they are beneficial, Psychologist [Susan Pinker](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_pinker_the_secret_to_living_longer_may_be_your_social_life) says that they are *not* the most important:

She visited the Italian island of Sardinia in the Mediterranean, where there are six times as many centenarians as on the Italian mainland, less than 200 miles away, and 10 times as many as there are in North America.

She states that the reason for this super longevity is the result of the close relationships she saw in person that every citizen has on the island.

She points to close relationships and social integration as the largest factors of predictability of a long life.

My personal experience backs up her claims as well.

Whenever I experience stress or any failure in life, I know that I can rely on my four best friends. They have my back no matter what, and I have theirs. They taught me that we should not let the unfortunate and inevitable negative impacts of life weigh us down. Knowing that there are people out there that you can count on for anything is a priceless feeling. It’s a feeling of constant reassurance, and everyone deserves to experience that feeling.

To conclude, I’d like to quote Amy Santiago from the hit television series Brooklyn 99:

> Life is unpredictable. Not everything’s in our control, but as long as you’re with the right people, you can handle anything.

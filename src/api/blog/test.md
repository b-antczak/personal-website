Here is a javascript code snippet:

```javascript
function foo() {
  alert('Hello world');
  // this is a comment
  console.log('Hello again');
}
```

Here is a python code snippet:
```python
def foo(self, name):
  // this is an invalid comment
  # this is a valid comment
  print('Hello, ' + name)
```

The purpose of this post is not to teach you how to use frameworks, but rather it provides (a fundamental understanding of what happens under the hood when you use a framework). For this post, we will be discussing frontend frameworks, using [hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp) as the framework we will be dissecting (because it's a very small framework and perfect for a post like this).

Keywords to focus on:
- Virtual DOM vs regular DOM (wth is a DOM anyways???)
- What is babel???
- What is webpack??? (Bundlers take JavaScript modules (or fonts, images, stylesheets), and combine them into one or a few files optimized for the browser.)


### Conlusion
Building a web app is seamless, but that's because there's a lot of work going on under the hood that you don't know of.
